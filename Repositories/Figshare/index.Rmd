## Figshare Overview

FigShare is a generic data repository capable of generating DOI.

### rfigshare

Package for writing and reading data from FigShare.

#### Read Data

Possible to read your own and other's data

#### Read Your Own Data

Browse through deposits:

```{r browse_figshare_deposits}
library(rfigshare)
my_deposits <- fs_browse()
```

Access information about a deposit with `fs_details`, note that the output of the object has been formatted for display purposes:

```{r}
fs_download(article_id = 3425729)

article_details <- fs_details(article_id = 3425729)
```


#### Read Other's Data

I guess we can make it such that we can read anyone else's stuff

### Deposit Data

I will write this later

## rfigshare and Shiny

I need to write instructions on how to incorporate login to a Shiny app.
